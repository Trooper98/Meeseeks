This repository was created during an OpenHack event in Gothenburg, October 2017. Our group decided to tackle i3tex's case for 
an app that facilitiates the lives of parents with special need childeren. We were very proud of our interface design and after 
a lot of work and arguing, we were able to come to a final "product" that ended up winning "Best Experience for Public Service"
award.

Being our/my first ever github repository, I have not changed/cleaned it up for the 
sake of nostalgia.
